# akan-names
This is a web application that will be used to derive the Akan Names based on the day of the week they were born and their genders. This project was developed by Alice Githui. The technologies used in the development of this project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap with JavaScript. 
In the process of developing this application, I focused on the values that are used to derive the Akan Name i.e. the day of birth and the gender of the person. The day of birth is derived from the date of birth. The user is also able to input their gender. Both of these will then inform the Akan Name of the user.
